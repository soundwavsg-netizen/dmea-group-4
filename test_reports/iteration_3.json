  "summary": "Completed comprehensive end-to-end testing of the new Presentations module. All 37 test cases passed successfully (100% success rate). The module includes two presentation pages: Friendly Persona Brief (4 slides) and Cluster & Persona Technical Slides (5 slides). All features are working correctly including presentation mode, keyboard navigation, slide indicators, sticky headers, and responsive design. Fixed one critical z-index bug that was blocking the exit button in presentation mode.",
